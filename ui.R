            individials (avg. 722 visits/day), 768 overdoses, 5,368 referrals to social

            have reversed nearly 5,000 overdoses, with no deaths, all while preventing 
            the spread of diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C and reducing dangerous 
            litter on local streets. Seeking funding and location commitment, Seattle 
            and King County will be the first to have facilities of its type on American

            urban core in November of 2016 alone. The primary purpose of SIFs are to 
            create a more controlled environment to reduce public drug use, create 
            relationships between the highly marginalized 'at-risk' population and health 
            care, and encourage the seeking out of medical care and addiction treatment. 
            This can be accomplished by providing clean injection equipment and medical 
            attention in the case of overdose (contaminated needles and OD being major 
            risk factors) as well as access/refferal to healthcare services."),

            population. The highest of those odds ratios were for experiencing a recent 
            overdose. The odds of someone having recently experienced an overdose given 
            that they attend the SIF are 2.7x higher than an IDU that does not attend 
            the SIF. The higher odds are ultimately good for two reasons. The first 
            being that it's preferable to have an IDU overdose in the presense of 
            medical staff and the resources to attend to/reverse the overdose. The other 
            being that it increases the likelihood of the higher-risk population to use 
            in the facilities rather than in the streets with variables that may be out 
            of their control. Our team believes a similar effect could be observed in 
            the city of Seattle and the rest of King County.")
