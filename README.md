# Safe Injection

In January 2017, Seattle and King County approved the creation of two safe injection sites (SIS) for drug users, the first in the United States, in effort to combat heroin/prescription opioid abuse-related deaths in the area. The SISs will provide a safe environment for consumption including resources and educataion for safer injection, as well as the overdose-reversing drug *naloxone* and connections to other treatment services. No funding or locations have been announced as of March 2017 but Seattle Mayor Ed Murray stated that the first will be located in the city of Seattle and the second will be outside the city.

The intended impact of these sites are to get drug use off the streets, reduce drug consumption-related overdoses/deaths, and provide users with injection/treatment resources. Obtaining data from the Seattle Police Department, this application will evaluate the opioid epidemic in the Seattle area and the extent to how a safe injection site would help elevate the impact on local communities.
